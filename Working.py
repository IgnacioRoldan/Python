# The data used are the reviews of Donna Tarttâ€™s The Goldfinch in the Amazon book review
# set from the Irivine Machine Learning Repository. These reviews have been stored
# in a simple tab separated file, which is nothing more than a plain text file
# with columns.
#  The table contains four columns:
#            review score, url, review title and review text.

# There are several ways imaginable to put this into a dictionary, but in this case,
#  you take the url as the dictionary keys and put the other columns in the
#  nested values dictionary.
